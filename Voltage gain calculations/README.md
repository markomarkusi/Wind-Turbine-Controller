Due to the op-amps used in the curcuits for the ammeter and voltmeter not being ideal, their gains were not constant at varying voltages. In order to improve the accuracy of our readings, plots of Gain vs. Voltage were produced to determine the gain at various voltages (instead of assuming a constant gain):
